## Topic heading

**Sub-topic heading**

Here is an example of a normal block of text. We want to limit the amount of text in this compendium as much as possible. Nonetheless it might be a good idea to collapse text together into bigger chunks were necesarry.

#### LaTex math block example

$$
\vec{P} = \bigg[\frac{30}{29}, \Â {8x}\bigg]
$$

#### Code block example

```go
foo float64 = 42.0;
func bar(in float64) {
  return in * in * in;
}
```
