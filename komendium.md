### Probability simulations using Python

**6 equal dice[^1]** - What is the probability of getting six equal dice in a throw?

```python
count = 0.0
i = 0
n = 1000000
while i < n:
	i += 1
	allsix = True
	for j in range(6):
		if randint(1,6) != 6:
			allsix = False
	if allsix: count += 1

```

**Area of unit circle[^1]** - Simulating the value of *PI*

```python
count = 0.0
n = 100000
i = 0
while i < n:
	i += 1
	x = uniform(-1,1)
	y = uniform(-1,1)
	if x*x + y*y < 1:    # test for inside circle
		count += 1

print(4*count / n)  #Bounding box has area 4, and count/n is the percentage of the bounding box
```

**Bus with 20 people[^1]** - There are 10 bus stops and people get off at uniformly distributed random stops. How many times does the bus stop? [^1]

```python
count = 0.0
n = 10000
i = 0
while i < n:
	i += 1
	l = [randint(1,10) for j in range(20)]
	m = set(l)
	count += len(m)

print(count / n)
```

**2x2 maze with rooms[^1]** - What is the average number of moves needed to go from room 0 to room 3?

```python
maze = [[1,2],[0,3],[0],[1]]  # We create the maze
n = 10000
i = 0
count = 0.0
while i < n:
	i += 1
	state = 0
	while state != 3:
		count += 1
		# A list is indexed by 0...len - 1
		state = maze[state][randint(0,len(maze[state])-1)]
		

print(count / n)

```

## 2. Markov Chains

A Markov Chain is a *network* with these two properties:

1. The weight of each edge represents a probability, and the value of the weights is in the range [0â€¦1].
2. The sum of all the weights leaving a node is **1**.

### States and chains

The nodes in a Markov Chain are called states. A state can be in two different modes.

**Transient state** -

**Absorbing state** -

**Absorbing chain** - 

**Ergodic chain** -

### The Stochastic Matrix

**Matrix blocks [Q, 0, R, I]** - 

### The Fundamental Matrix N

| Operation  | Symbol      | Signature     |

| Or         | \|          | 0 - 1 - 1 - 1 |
| Xor        | ^           | 0 - 1 - 1 - 0 |
| Not        | ~  (not or) | 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 |
| ShiftLeft  | <<          | <<1 == 10     |

#### **Physics in games**

Games tend to take certain freedoms in the way they implement physics. This is of course to make something that is better than the real world. See Lens

**Double jump** -

**Varying gravity** - 

#### LERP - Linear Interpolation

LERP is commonly used as the name of the funciton, which implements *Linear interpolation*

```javascript
function LERP (float t, Vector a, Vector b) 
{
   return (1-t)*a + t*b;
}
```
